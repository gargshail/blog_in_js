## Tinycore Linux

It is really tiny but packed with tons of things. I use it a lot to create a specfic setup to troubleshoot various issues.
You can install the bare minimum and then add components that you need.
I've created Hadoop lab in a box that runs cluster of 8 servers. Very useful to experience different scenario. For example what happend when nameserver goes down.
Or what happens when you add a new datanode. 

In this I'll walk through steps to create a VM in VirtualBox. Also explain necessary steps of customizations.
